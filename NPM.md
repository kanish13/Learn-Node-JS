How to get started ?

Step 1: Install Node.js

Before you can use npm, you need to have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

Step 2: Verify Installation

After installing Node.js, you should have npm installed by default. To verify this, open a terminal (or command prompt) and run the following commands:

    node -v
    npm -v

Step 3: Create a Project Directory

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. You can use the cd command to change directories.

    cd path/to/your/project

Step 4: Initialize a Node.js Project

Inside your project directory, initialize a new Node.js project by running:

    npm init

This command will prompt you to provide information about your project, such as its name, version, description, entry point, and more. You can press Enter to accept the default values or provide your own.

Step 5: Install Packages

To install packages (dependencies) for your project, you can use the npm install command followed by the package name. For example, to install the popular package lodash, you would run:

    npm install lodash

You can also install multiple packages at once:

    npm install package1 package2

Step 6: Save Dependencies

By default, npm will save the installed packages to your project's package.json file. This file keeps track of your project's dependencies. If you use the --save or -S flag (which is the default behavior in newer npm versions), the package will be added to the dependencies section:

    npm install package-name --save
